Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's turtle module. 
The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. 
The goal is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the snake grows longer.

Game Features:

Snake movement: The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction (up, down, left, right).
Food: The snake eats food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and the score increases.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Score: The score increases as the snake eats food. It is displayed at the top of the screen.
